To run this you need 2 powershells 1 for backend and one for frontend
- cd backend and cd frontend

Next install npm dependecies for both backend and frontend
- npm i 

Generate prisma in backend
- npx prisma generate

Create an env file for both backend and frontend // note must be inside backend and frontend folder
- right click backend create file name it .env
- same as frontend

Once env files are created chat me to receive the details for the env files
- Chat me

Once everything is setup you can run the system now
- use npm run dev on both backend and frontend

//Additional Notes
To upload a property go to properties page (Landlord account), fill in the details and there you go

Now your property is not yet going to be seen by the tenants, for it to be seen
- Create a unit for that property first
- Fill in all credentials and create the unit
- Go back to your properties that you created the unit at 
- View details
- Units
- View details
- There should be a button for list property now

Login to either a tenant account or admin account
- For the accounts again chat me
- On tenants you shouldn't see the property yet (Hopefully)
- On admin go to property request and you should see the / and X
- Once approved go back to a tenant account and see if the details is being displayed

!IMPORTANT ONCES!
- DO NOT I MEAN DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING IN THE CODE ESPECIALLY ON THE DATABASE SINCE THE DATABASE USED IS MINE AND THE CHANGES WILL AFFECT GLOBALLY
- DASHBOARD SOMEWHAT REFLECT REAL DATA NOW
- THERE IS NO EMAIL VERIFICATION FOR NOW BECAUSE OF REDIS (I STILL HAVE TO FIGURE THAT ONE FIRST)
