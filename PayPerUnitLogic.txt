What I Actually Implemented
1. Dependencies Installed
I installed Stripe packages for payment processing:

# Frontend
npm install @stripe/stripe-js stripe

# Backend
npm install stripe

2. Payment System Architecture
Important: I created a SIMULATED/SANDBOX payment system, not a real one. Here's how:
Frontend Payment Modal (ListingPaymentModal.tsx)
UI Components: Created a professional payment interface
Payment Methods: Shows Card and GCash options (but they're just UI buttons)
Commission Calculation: Automatically calculates 3% of monthly rent
Simulated Processing: Uses setTimeout() to simulate 3-second payment processing
Mock Payment ID: Generates fake payment intent IDs like pi_1234567890_abc123
Key Code in Payment Modal:

// This is NOT a real payment - it's simulated!
const handlePayment = async () => {
setIsProcessing(true);
setPaymentStep('processing');

try {
// Simulate payment processing (3 second delay)
await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 3000));

// Generate fake payment ID
const mockPaymentIntentId = `pi_${Date.now()}_${Math.random().toString(36).substr(2, 9)}`;

setPaymentStep('success');
// ... rest of success handling
} catch (error) {
// Error handling
}
};

3. Integration with Unit Details
Modified toggleListing Function:

// Before: Direct API call
const toggleListing = async () => {
await requestListingRequest(propertyId, unitId, { notes: "..." });
};

// After: Show payment modal first
const toggleListing = () => {
setShowPaymentModal(true); // Opens payment modal
};

// New function: Handle payment success
const handlePaymentSuccess = async (paymentIntentId: string) => {
await requestListingRequest(propertyId, unitId, {
notes: `Payment ID: ${paymentIntentId}`,
paymentIntentId: paymentIntentId
});
};


4. What I Did NOT Do
❌ No Real API Integration: I didn't connect to actual Stripe or GCash APIs
❌ No Real Payment Processing: No actual money transactions
❌ No Webhook Handling: No real payment verification
❌ No Database Payment Records: No actual payment storage

5. What I DID Do
✅ UI/UX: Created professional payment interface
✅ Simulation: Mock payment processing with realistic timing
✅ State Management: Proper loading states and error handling
✅ Commission Logic: Automatic 3% calculation
✅ Integration: Connected payment flow to listing request
✅ Sandbox Safety: Clear indicators that it's test mode
🎯 The "Payment" Flow
User clicks "List Your Property Now"
Payment modal opens (shows 3% commission)
User selects payment method (Card/GCash - just UI)
"Payment processing" (3-second fake delay)
Success screen (shows fake confirmation)
Listing request submitted (with fake payment ID)
🛡️ Why This Approach?
Safe for Students: No real money involved
Realistic Experience: Looks and feels like real payment
Easy to Test: Can test the full flow without payment setup
Production Ready: Easy to replace simulation with real APIs later
🔄 To Make It Real Later
If you wanted real payments, you'd need to:
Replace the setTimeout simulation with actual Stripe API calls
Add real webhook handling for payment verification
Store actual payment records in database
Remove sandbox notices and add real payment processing
Bottom Line: I created a realistic-looking payment system that simulates the entire flow without any real money transactions - perfect for a student project! 🎉
